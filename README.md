## Install

```sh
npm install
```

## Usage

```sh
npm run start
```
## How to Play

To begin, the player must specify a non zero number. Upon clicking submit, three buttons will populate the center of the screen: New game, 'Roll, and 'Hold'. A player may continue rolling as long as he/she wishes and accumulate points to their 'Current' counter respectively. However, if the user rolls a 1 on either of the two dice, they will be alerted that they lose their points for that turn, and the next player will be up. Similarly, if a player rolls double sixes at any point,they will lose ALL points earned - both 'Current' and cumulative. If a player is satisfied with their 'Current' points at any given time, or simply wishes to pass without rolling, they may click the 'Hold' button.

## Run tests

```sh
npm run test
```
